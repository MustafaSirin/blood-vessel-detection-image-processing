Blood Vessel Detection Using Image Processing Techniques

This project demonstrates multiple vessel segmentation methods applied to retinal images:

LoG 3D Filtering

Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)

Frangi Vesselness Filter

Morphological Operations

Each method is implemented in separate modules.
The goal is to compare different segmentation approaches and evaluate their performance.
